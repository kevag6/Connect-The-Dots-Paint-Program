# Connect-The-Dots-Paint-Program
A GUI application which inputs dots and the click of the users mouse and then connects the dots when a user double-clicks

Below I will explain how the basic GUI project works

In order to draw a dot on the panel the user makes a simple left click on their mouse. The user can continuosly do this on the panel.

To connect the dots the user Double-clicks their mouse.

To erase the painting they created, they must double-click again.

The user may also change the thickness of the pen which connects the dots as well as change the color of the pen.

Lastly the user may save the painting that they created (This was made possible using XML) and reopen the painting, using the save and open buttons.
